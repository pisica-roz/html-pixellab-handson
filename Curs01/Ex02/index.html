    A Man Without A Country: Abhorring willful ignorance and unquestioning belief in myths that too often make enemies
    of otherwise benign souls,
    Vonnegut addresses our personal animi, our wars, and our impending planetary destruction from climate change. He
    summarizes the human situation coming from the dangers inherent in herding under the advice of politicians and
    religious leaders whose guesses and teachings are too often based on something other than fact or foresight.

    Bluebeard: The memoir of “minimal painter” Rabo Karabekian, admittedly saved by wonderful women he credits with
    bringing him
    back to life, Lazarus-like. The novel’s arc culminates in unveiling Karabekian’s masterpiece, a triptych entitled
    “Now It’s the Women’s Turn.” It is the repainted canvas of his “Windsor Blue Number Seventeen,” what was a single
    band of color representing one’s individual awareness. Product suicide destroys the abstract masterpiece when the
    Sateen Dura-Luxe paint peels away while stored in a basement facility.

    Jailbird: Vonnegut’s Watergate novel, rooted in the travesties of Sacco and Vanzetti as well as the early factory
    union
    movement opposed by private armies of strikebreakers, illustrating that our willful ignorance of historical truth
    consigns us to continued victimization. Ignoring objective truth in the name of institutional salvation opens the
    way for establishment schizophrenia.
